# Streaming configuration

![](doc/img.png)

A [mongodb change-streams](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/changeStreams/) powered hot-reloadable configuration Go library. 

Can be used in your Go distributed services for:

* feature flag activation/deactivation;
* dynamic configuration change without need for container/service restarts;

A typical usecase is a kubernetes replicaset/deployment with multiple pods - upon configuration changes all pods local configurations will be updated.

The user-provided configuration must support `json` field tags for serialization/deserialization.

## Design

* Auditable: the library aims at keeping historical information about configuration changesâ€”this is achieved at the price of 
 higher storage consumption as each configuration change translates to a new document in the collection containing all configuration 
fields.
* Immutable: the configurations are versioned and immutable - every update is reflected as a new document.
* Eventually-consistent: a configuration change will be replicated to the other local repositories eventually.
* Default values are not persisted, they are local-only. This allows you to change default values
  when rolling out new configuration versions.

## Usage

checkout the [example](./example/server/main.go).

1. Define a configuration with `json` field tags (and optionally with `default` field tags):
2. Make sure that your configuration type implements the `streamingconfig.Config` interface:
3. Instantiate and start the repository and use it. 

## Test

```shell
make dependencies_up
make tests
```

### Run example server

```shell
make dependencies_up
make example
```

Optionally, you can also start a second server to check that the changes happening in one server will be reflected in the other:

```shell
HTTP_PORT=8081 make example
```

#### Getting latest configuration request
```shell
curl -X GET --location "http://localhost:8080/configs/latest"
```
#### Changing latest configuration request
```shell
curl -X PUT --location "http://localhost:8080/configs/latest" \
    -H "user-id: mark" \
    -d '{
  "name": "betty",
  "age": 35
}'
```
#### Listing multiple versions
```shell
curl -X GET --location "http://localhost:8080/configs?fromVersion=0&toVersion=21"
```
